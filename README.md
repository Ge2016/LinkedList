Assignment 4: Managing a Linked List of Things 
In this assignment, you are asked to implement a bag collection using a linked list and, in order to focus on the linked list implementation details, we will implement the collection to store only one type of Thing of your choice (i.e., not generic). 

In order to complete this project, you need to implement the following classes. The details of each of these classes are explained below: 

• Thing: you may use the same Thing you used for the previous assignments. But make sure to look for the requirements below and change your previous implementation as necessary. 

• ThingNode: a linked list node where the data part is of type Thing. 

• ThingLinkedBag: a collection of Things in which the elements are stored in a linked list. 

• ThingLinkedBagDriver: that includes a main method to test the functionality of your collection.
